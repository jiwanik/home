			Chemical Elements
		</h3>
		<p>
			An element is a substance that cannot be further broken down into simpler compositions. Elements are provided on the periodic table of elements. On this table of, elements each element is differentiated by an atomic number. This number represents how many protons and electrons are on the ion as long as it is neutral.

		<h3>
			Organization of the Periodic Table
		</h3>
		<p>
			The periodic table is designed specifically to group the elements in more than one category. The most obvious way is that the atomic number ascends the further along the table you go. Secondly, all elements in the same column have the same number of valence electrons. The valence electrons are a number of electrons in the outermost shell or ring of the atom. Thirdly the elements are put into their own categories based on the characteristics they share amongst themselves. One of those characteristics is whether the element is a metal, metalloid &#40;between metal and non-metal&#41; or non-metal. If you have ever looked at a periodic table most of it from the left side stretching past the half-way mark is marked as metals. Then there is a thin line of elements tagged as metalloids going diagonally across the right side of the table then the other side of the metalloid line &#40;the right side&#41; is left to be only non-metals. The other categorical way the periodic table is organised is through its column. The very first column on the left side is known as the alkali metals, the next is the alkaline earth metals. Contrasting on the right side, the last column on the left side is known as the noble gases and the column just before is the halogen gases.
